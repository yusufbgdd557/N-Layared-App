# N-Layered Architecture Java Project

## Overview
This project serves as a practical demonstration of N-Layered Architecture, featuring key implementations and Dependency Injection concepts. 

## Purpose
The primary aim of this project is to provide a straightforward example of how N-Layered Architecture can be applied in Java-based applications. It showcases the importance of separating concerns and the use of Dependency Injection to promote flexibility and maintainability.

## Features
- **Layered Structure**: The project highlights the division of an application into distinct layers, including the Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer.
- **Dependency Injection**: Demonstrates the concept of Dependency Injection, a method to manage component dependencies in a more flexible and maintainable way.
- **Sample Implementations**: Provides practical code samples within each layer to illustrate how they interact.
